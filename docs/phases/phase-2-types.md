# Phase 2: Complete Types & API Rewrite ✅ COMPLETE
**Completed**: January 2025

## What was accomplished:
- **Complete API rewrite** with proper types architecture and standardized responses
- **Multi-game rental system** implemented with proper validation
- **Enhanced user capabilities** for rental management (cancellation, game changes)
- **Comprehensive testing** with 80+ test cases covering all endpoints
- **Type architecture modernization** with layered approach (schema → models → computed → api)

## Key Features Implemented:
- **Multiple Games Per Rental**: Users can request 1-10 games in a single rental
- **Center Constraint**: All games must be from the same center
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Cancellation and game changes for pending rentals
- **Role-based Access Control**: Proper permission verification for all endpoints
- **Standardized Response Format**: Consistent API responses across all endpoints

## Technical Improvements:
- **Query Object Consistency**: All endpoints use predefined query objects
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with generated types
- **Business Logic**: Comprehensive validation and constraint checking
- **Database Operations**: Efficient Prisma queries with proper include/select patterns

## Type System Established:
```
