# Phase 1: APIs & Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETE
**Completed**: January 2025

## What was accomplished:
- **All 18 API endpoints** implemented and tested successfully
- **Global middleware** system for authentication and role-based access control
- **Comprehensive testing framework** with automated endpoint verification
- **Consistent API response format** using standardized `apiResponse` function
- **Input validation** using Zod schemas across all endpoints
- **Database operations** optimized with Prisma ORM
- **Security implementation** with JWT tokens, password hashing, and proper error handling

## Key Technical Achievements:
- Role-based access control with hierarchical permissions (ADMIN > SUPER_COORDINATOR > CENTER_COORDINATOR > USER)
- Soft deletion strategy for all resources (centers, games, users)
- Pagination support across all list endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety

## APIs Implemented:
- **Public APIs**: Games catalog, Centers listing
- **User APIs**: Rental management (create, update, view)  
- **Coordinator APIs**: Game instance management
- **Super Coordinator APIs**: Center supervision, rental oversight, game management
- **Admin APIs**: Complete CRUD for users, centers, games, plus role assignment and system monitoring

## Testing Results: 
18/18 endpoints verified, database schema validated, middleware functioning correctly
