# User Role Removal - Completed Phase

## Overview
Removed the USER role from the system to simplify permission management. Regular users now have empty roles arrays and access is controlled through center relationships.

## Changes Made

### Database Schema
- ✅ Removed `USER` from Role enum in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- ✅ Kept roles field in User model (still used for admin/coordinator roles)
- ✅ Generated migration to update database
- ✅ Updated seed data to create users without USER role

### Database State
- Role enum now contains: `CENTER_COORDINATOR`, `SUPER_COORDINATOR`, `ADMIN`
- Regular users have empty roles arrays `[]`
- All existing role-based relationships preserved (center coordinators, super coordinators, admins)

## Seed Data Created
- 1 Admin user
- 2 Super coordinators  
- 5 Center coordinators
- 7 Regular users (no roles)
- 5 Centers across different areas
- 8 Games with various categories
- 23 Game instances distributed across centers
- 6 Rental scenarios (active, pending, returned, cancelled)

## Test Credentials
- Admin: admin@gamerental.co.il / Admin123!
- Super Coordinator: david.manager@gamerental.co.il / SuperCoord123!
- Coordinator: sarah.coord@gamerental.co.il / Coordinator123!
- User: john.doe@email.com / User123!
- Google User: david.wilson@email.com (OAuth)

## Business Logic Impact
- Regular users no longer have explicit roles
- Access control simplified to center-based permissions
- Admin/coordinator roles still function as before
- Authentication system unchanged

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Database migration successful, seed data populated
