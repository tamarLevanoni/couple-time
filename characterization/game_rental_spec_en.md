## 8. Points for Clarification and Improvement

### 8.1 Open Questions
1. **Inventory management**: What happens when there's a conflict between rental data and availability?
2. **Coordinator flexibility**: How much freedom to give coordinators to update dates without restrictions?
3. **Popular games**: Should we add a waiting list or advance booking system?
4. **Super coordinator tasks**: What type of tasks will super coordinators receive from administrators?
5. **Integrated dashboard**: Should a coordinator who is also an admin see everything in one place or separately?
